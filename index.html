					<br><p>My name is Victor Tang, and I am excited to welcome you to Alpha Phi Omega!<br><br>
					When I pledged Fall 2014, I was unaware of the prospects and opportunities that this fraternity presented, but I quickly learned of the three cardinal principles by which Alpha Phi Omega lives by – Leadership, Friendship, and Service. From small events to serving on the Executive Board, Alpha Phi Omega encourages everyone to shoulder responsibilities and develop into strong leaders. Here, you will find that its members, whether within the chapter or at another college, are all welcoming and kind. We are always there when you need us – a second family that you can turn to when times are tough.<br><br>
					But the true value of Alpha Phi Omega lies in its dedication to service. Our chapter has been a strong presence on the UC Berkeley campus since 1939, and has since contributed to quality service for the chapter, campus, community, and country. Our service calendar covers such a diverse medley of service projects that anyone will find something they relate to and enjoy. Our brothers come from a diverse range of majors, backgrounds, and passions, yet we are all united through a common goal of fostering brotherhood through providing service to those around us.<br><br>
					I look forward to welcoming the Fall 2016 pledge class!</p></br>
